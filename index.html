			Having gained an extra week from Thanksgiving, I spent the time updating the visual comps. I realized in hindsight
			that there were a few sections of my site that didn't really help the narrative, such as parallax scrolling. The
			content also seemed a bit dry and I wanted to make it more engaging. With these realizations, I decided to remove
			parallax scrolling for my hero section but instead create hero section that disappears with a timer - much like Snapchat. I also used
			Principal to mimick the interaction design of ephemeral messages. Finally, I decided to fade out the content at the end to once
			again mimick the power of ephemerality.

				Based on last week's critique, I learned that there is a lot more emphasis on having a solid narrative
				than making a site with cool effects. I was very much fixated on which plugins would look the coolest
				without considering a consistent narrative. I decided that I would focus on the visual language of ephemeral
				messaging instead of trying to cover multiple topics from security to snapchat use worldwide. I think I want
				to integrate a parallax scrolling effect and a chat.

			<p class="legibility">For today's class, we learned an Intro to Javascript. We were taught: Properties, Methods, Events</p>
			<p class="legibility">I think JavaScript will be useful in creating my dialogue chat on ephemeral messaging - using FadeOut to make certain elements disappear.
			I was set all week on trying to fork an existing code from a conversational website, but to my dismay, there were too many functions to filter through that
			the code got buggy. I decided to consult the jQuery library and look for JavaScript animations myself. I wrote out the proposed code and tried a few scripts.
			After some success, I knew I could begin to wireframe the chat. What stumped me was coming up with a unique data vis. that could compliment my chat. I think
			I may try to use the twitter API to calculate the word frequencies of the words "Snapchat" and "Instagram Stories". I also want to keep in mind of the UI/UX
			comparison between these two social medias. I think I will use Isotope to group together common and differing characteristics.</p>

			<p class="legibility">For the first class, we went over ways of categorizing information in the form of John Maeda's SLIP, and Richard Saul Wurman LATCH “hatrack”.
				We also talked about the arrow of disruption in technology which I found particularly intriguing with the topic I chose on
				Ephemeral Messaging.
			</p>
			<p class="legibility">“Ephemeral messaging is the mobile-to-mobile transmission of multimedia messages that automatically disappear from
				the recipient's screen after the message has been viewed. The word "ephemeral" describes something that only lasts
				for a short period of time.” <i>TechCrunch</i></p>
			<p class="legibility">Ephemeral messages which "self-destruct" can be contrasted with SMS text messaging and
				iMessage, both of which require the recipient to physically delete messages from the device. This research reports
				analyzes the disruption ephemeral messaging has and continues to have on society.</p>
